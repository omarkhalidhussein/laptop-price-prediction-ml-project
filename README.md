# laptop-price-prediction-ml-project
A machine learning project developed during the NTI training, focused on predicting laptop prices based on specifications.
This project showcases the end-to-end machine learning workflow — starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering, and culminating in model training, testing, and performance evaluation — all with the goal of achieving the best possible prediction accuracy, with plans for future improvements and extensions.
