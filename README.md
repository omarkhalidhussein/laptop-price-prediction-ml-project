# 💻 Laptop Price Predictor

A machine learning web app that predicts laptop prices based on selected hardware features such as processor, RAM, storage, GPU, and more.  
Built with Python, trained using a Kaggle dataset, and deployed using Streamlit for a clean and interactive GUI.

## 🧠 How It Works
The user selects laptop features (e.g., CPU, RAM, Storage).

The app processes the input and feeds it into a trained ML model.

The model returns the predicted price instantly.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
Add more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

Improve accuracy through hyperparameter tuning

Enhance UI/UX

Add multilingual support
